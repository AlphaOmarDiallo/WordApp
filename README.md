Android developer codelab - Android Room with a View - Java

https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view#0

In this codelab, you'll learn how to design and construct an app using the Architecture Components Room, ViewModel, and LiveData, and build an app that does the following:

* Implements our recommended architecture using the Android Architecture Components.
* Works with a database to get and save the data, and pre-populates the database with some words.
* Displays all the words in a RecyclerView in MainActivity.
* Opens a second activity when the user taps the + button. When the user enters a word, adds the word to the database and the list.
